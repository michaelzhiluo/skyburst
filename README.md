# Starburst ‚≠ê: A Cost-aware Scheduler for Cloud Bursting

**Usenix ATC'24 Artifact Evaluation**

# Abstract

This guide is designed you to set up, run experiments, and replicate evaluation for Starburst. We split this document into 3 sections:

- **Setup**: How to setup Starburst (both simulator and our real-world experiments) in your Python environment OR through Docker.
- **Simulator Exps**: Run all our simulation experiments and replicate our results.
- **Real-World Exps**: Run our schedulers over Kubernetes on-prem cluster and run job submission pipeline. We place this last, as it is much more complicated and takes much longer to run.

# Setup


# Simulation Experiments

We note that all our simulators logs for all our experiments (including Appendix) are saved in a public Google Cloud Storage bucket: `gs://starburst_bucket/logs`. If the user wants to save time, all our results can be directly fetched from this bucket and directly plotted with the Jupyter notebooks provided in `skyburst/plots`. 

To do so, install Gcloud and run the following command:
```
# Will download the logs to ~/log
gsutil -m cp -r gs://starburst_bucket/logs ~/
```

However, we also provide bash commands below to generate the logs for each figure below. This is also provided in the repo, in `skyburst/simulator_scripts`. Note that these experiments can take  5min-1 hour to complete on a 48 CPU machine.

## Fig 7: End2End Simulator Results

To run End2End experiments with both Philly and Helios traces, run:
```
simulator_scripts/fig7.sh
```

This will output logs to the path `~/logs/philly_end2end.log` and `~/logs/helios_end2end.log`.
Use `skyburst/notebooks/fig7_simulator_end2end.ipynb` to plot the graphs with the corresponding logs.

## Fig 8: End2End Pareto Curves

To run End2End pareto curve experiments with both Philly and Helios traces, run:
```
simulator_scripts/fig8.sh
```

This will output logs to the path `~/logs/philly_pareto.log` and `~/logs/helios_pareto.log`.
Use `skyburst/notebooks/fig8_pareto_ipynb.ipynb` to plot the graphs with the corresponding logs.


## Fig 9: Ablation over Waiting Policies.

To run ablations over different waiting policies, run:
```
simulator_scripts/fig9.sh
```

This will output logs to the path `~/logs/ablate_waiting_policies.log`.
Use `skyburst/notebooks/fig9_ablate_waiting_policy.ipynb` to plot the graphs with the corresponding logs.


## Fig 10: Ablation over Pareto Curves

To run ablations over the pareto curves for different waiting policies and out-of-order scheduling, run:
```
simulator_scripts/fig10.sh
```

This will output logs to the path `~/logs/ablate_waiting_policies_pareto.log` and `~/logs/ablate_out_of_order_pareto.log`.
Use `skyburst/notebooks/fig10_ablate_pareto.ipynb` to plot the graphs with the corresponding logs.

## Fig 11: Ablation over Out-of-Order Scheduling

To run ablations over out-of-order scheduling, run:
```
simulator_scripts/fig11.sh
```

This will output logs to the path `~/logs/ablate_out_of_order.log`.
Use `skyburst/notebooks/fig11_ablate_out_of_order.ipynb` to plot the graphs with the corresponding logs.


## Fig 12: P90/P99 Waiting Times

To run experiments over the 90th and 99th percentile waiting times, run:
```
simulator_scripts/fig12.sh
```

This will output logs to the path `~/logs/ablate_jct_percentile.log`.
Use `skyburst/notebooks/fig12_ablate_jct_percentile.ipynb` to plot the graphs with the corresponding logs.


## Fig 13: Ablate Waiting Budget

To run ablations over our waiting budget framework, run:
```
simulator_scripts/fig13.sh
```

This will output logs to the path `~/logs/ablate_philly_waiting_budget.log` and `~/logs/ablate_helios_waiting_budget.log`.
Use `skyburst/notebooks/fig13_ablate_waiting_budget.ipynb` to plot the graphs with the corresponding logs.

## Table 4: MILP Experiments

Our MILP experiments requires access to GUROBI, a popular mathematical optimization solver. However, Gurobi requires a key.

## Fig 14: Starburst w.r.t Bursty Workloads

To run ablations over bursty workloads (Starburst w.r.t different Coefficient of Variances for a Gamma arrival distribution), run:
```
simulator_scripts/fig14.sh
```

This will output logs to the path `~/logs/burst.log`.
Use `skyburst/notebooks/fig14_ablate_robustness.ipynb` to plot the graphs with the corresponding logs.

## Fig 15: Queueing and Binpacking Policies

To run pareto curves for Starburst over different queueing and binpacking policies, run:
```
simulator_scripts/fig15.sh
```

This will output logs to the path `~/logs/sched_alg_pareto.log` and `~/logs/binpack_pareto.log`.
Use `skyburst/notebooks/fig15_ablate_queue_binpack.ipynb` to plot the graphs with the corresponding logs.
